1. What is JSX?
Combination of JS and HTML. It helps you to write the code directly into the JS part instead of making differnt files for JS and HTML
e.g., 
this is the HTML part...
<>
    <h2>Apple</h2> 
</>

this is the HTML part inside the JS functions and it is combinedly called JSX...
function Fruit(){
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Apple</h2>
    </>
  )
}


2. How to use React without JSX?
return createElement("div", {id:"rootDiv"}, "hello inside div")

this is one of the examples and from here we can understand it is complex and confusing and it takes a lot of time as well
and react is mostly popular because of JSX

3. Difference between JS function call and React function call
make a function -> make button and click event -> call function on click event -> call arrow function -> pass parameters with function call
- in react we use camel case instead of normal lowercase as in JS
- also don't use braces [()] when calling the function inside react just pass the name because the onClick function in react just needs the function's defination and not the function call, it calls the function itself
- to pass a parameter inside the function in react we need pass it as an arrow function
e.g., <button onClick = {()=>fruit("apple")}></button>
